CHANGELOG - Room Balancing Algorithm
=====================================

Version 1.1 - Critical Business Logic Fix
------------------------------------------

FIXED: Downgrade Prevention
- Removed all downgrade paths from cross-category upgrades
- Added isDowngrade() function to detect tier and bed downgrades
- Emergency logic now skips downgrades - would rather walk guest
- Named suite logic also protected against downgrades

REMOVED Invalid Cross-Category Paths:
✗ KSVN → TDBN (Park View King to Standard Double - NEVER)
✗ KNGN → TDBN (King to Double - downgrade)
✗ NKSP → KNGN (Premium to Standard - downgrade)
✗ All other downgrade scenarios

KEPT Valid Cross-Category Paths:
✓ TDBN → KNGN/KSVN/KEXN (Standard Double to Kings - upgrade)
✓ TSVN → KSVN/KEXN (Park View Double to Premium Kings - upgrade)
✓ ADA → Non-ADA same/better tier (when ADA exhausted)

Business Logic: 
- Would rather WALK a guest than downgrade them
- Protects guest experience and hotel reputation
- Aligns with real MOD decision-making

Version 1.0 - Initial Release
------------------------------
- Rate type priority algorithm
- MOD approval workflow
- ADA compliance handling
- Overbooking management

Version 1.2 - Flexible Approval Workflow
-----------------------------------------

CHANGED: Partial Approval System
- MOD can now finalize with SOME alerts checked (not all required)
- Approved alerts → Guests get assigned
- Unchecked alerts → Remain as "Unresolved - Manual Handling Required"
- Finalize button shows count: "Finalize 15 Approved (5 Remain)"

Real-World Scenario:
- 20 alerts appear (overbookings, upgrades, etc.)
- MOD handles 15 (calls guests, gets approval)
- Can finalize those 15 immediately
- Remaining 5 escalated to GM or guests walked

Benefits:
- More realistic MOD workflow
- Don't need to handle everything before finalizing
- Partial completion supported
- Clear visibility of remaining issues
