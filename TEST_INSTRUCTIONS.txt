2. Leave the rest unchecked

Expected Result:
- First 2 alerts should get green background (approved state)
- Button should become ENABLED (blue)
- Button text should change to: "✓ Finalize 2 Approved (X Remain)"
  (where X = total alerts - 2)

STEP 3: Click Finalize
-----------------------

  - Upgrades: some number
- Orange banner appears: "⚠️ X Unresolved Alerts - Manual Handling Required"
- Banner lists the unchecked alerts with details
- Assignments table shows only successfully assigned guests
- Walk guests do NOT appear in assignments table

STEP 4: Verify Walk Guests Excluded
------------------------------------
1. Scroll through assignments table
2. Search for guest names from "WALK GUEST" alerts

Expected Result:
- Walk guest names should NOT appear in table
- Only guests with actual room assignments should be listed

STEP 5: Test "Check All"
-------------------------
1. Go back (reload page)
2. Repeat steps 1-2
3. This time, check ALL checkboxes

Expected Result:

- When clicked, green banner appears: "✓ All room assignments finalized"
- No unresolved alerts section

3. Don't check any checkboxes

Expected Result:
- Button remains DISABLED (gray)
- Cannot click finalize
- Button text: "Finalize Room Assignments (Check at least one alert)"
