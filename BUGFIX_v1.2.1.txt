VERSION 1.2.1 - BUGFIX: Partial Approval Not Working
=====================================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
-----------------
User reported that checking some boxes (but not all) was not enabling 
the finalize button or properly filtering assignments.

ROOT CAUSES FIXED:
------------------

1. Button State Update
   - Added proper null checks in updateApprovalStatus()
   - Added initialization call after creating checkboxes
   - Fixed button text to show "Check at least one alert" when disabled
   - Ensured button updates immediately on checkbox change

2. Assignment Filtering
   - Clarified logic: standard assignments always included
   - Special assignments (upgrades, cross-category, etc.) only included if approved
   - Added explicit checks for whether assignment has associated alert

3. Walk Guest Handling
   - Added explicit comment: walk guest alerts do NOT create assignments
   - These guests have no room, so don't appear in finalAssignments at all

4. Display Logic
   - Fixed banner insertion to properly remove old banners
   - Improved unresolved alerts formatting
   - Better messaging about what happens next

TESTING CHECKLIST:
------------------
□ Load Jan 17 date (should have walk guest alerts)
□ Check 2 out of 6 alerts
□ Button should say "Finalize 2 Approved (4 Remain)"
□ Click finalize
□ Should see 2 guests handled, 4 unresolved alerts shown
□ Stats should show: Total 321, Assigned 315 (or similar)

KNOWN BEHAVIOR:
---------------
- Button disabled until at least ONE checkbox is checked
- Checked alerts → Assignments finalized
- Unchecked alerts → Shown as "Unresolved" in results
- Walk guests → Never appear in assignments table
