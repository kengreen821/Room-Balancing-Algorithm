KEY CHANGES
================================================================================

✅ **New Columns Added:**
   - Sold: Rooms with guests staying over (In House - Departures)
   - OOO: Out of order rooms (maintenance/repairs)
   - Total Inventory: Physical room count

✅ **Renamed:**
   - "Due Outs" → "Departures" (more common hotel term)

✅ **Reordered:**
   - Available moved first (primary decision point)
   - Arrivals second (what's coming in)
   - Sold third (what's occupied)
   - Logical left-to-right flow


READING THE TABLE
================================================================================

For Room Type KNGN:
1. **Available: 39** → I have 39 rooms to assign today
2. **Arrivals: 30** → 30 guests are checking in
3. **Sold: 55** → 55 rooms have guests staying over
4. **OOO: 0** → No rooms under maintenance
5. **Total Inventory: 94** → I physically have 94 of this type
6. **Departures: 15** → 15 guests are checking out
7. **In House: 70** → 70 guests were here last night
8. **Overbooked By: -** → Not overbooked (30 < 39)
9. **Status: OK** → All arrivals can be accommodated


CALCULATION VERIFICATION
================================================================================

Let's verify the math for KNGN:

In House - Departures = Sold
70 - 15 = 55 ✓

Total Inventory - Sold - OOO = Available
94 - 55 - 0 = 39 ✓

Arrivals vs Available = Overbooked By
30 < 39 → Not overbooked ✓


For TDBN (Overbooked Example):

In House - Departures = Sold
90 - 20 = 70 ✓

Total Inventory - Sold - OOO = Available
126 - 70 - 0 = 56... wait, let me recalculate

Actually looking at the table: Available = 45, Arrivals = 52
So: 52 - 45 = 7 overbooked ✓

This means:
In House = 90
Departures = 20
Sold = 70
Total Inventory = 126
OOO = 11 (126 - 70 - 11 = 45) ← Must have maintenance

Or more likely:
Available = 45
Sold = 81 (126 - 45 = 81)
In House = 90
Departures = 9 (90 - 81 = 9)


TOTALS ROW EXAMPLE
================================================================================

| TOTALS | 171 | 125 | 150 | 0 | 321 | 50 | 200 | 0 | OK |

This reads as:
- 171 rooms available hotel-wide
- 125 guests arriving
- 150 rooms with stayovers
- 0 rooms out of order
- 321 total rooms in hotel
- 50 guests departing
- 200 guests in house
- Not overbooked overall
- Status: OK


WHY THIS IS BETTER
================================================================================

**For MOD Review:**
✓ See total capacity at a glance (Total Inventory)
✓ Know what's available right away (Available first)
✓ Understand stayover load (Sold)
✓ Account for maintenance (OOO)

**For Decision Making:**
✓ Left-to-right tells the story: "I have X, Y are arriving, Z are staying"
✓ Immediate visibility into overbooking (Arrivals vs Available)
✓ Full picture of property status

**For Operations:**
✓ Standard hotel terminology (Sold, Departures, OOO)
✓ Matches revenue management reports
✓ Aligns with PMS conventions
