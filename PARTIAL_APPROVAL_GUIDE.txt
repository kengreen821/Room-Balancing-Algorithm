PARTIAL APPROVAL WORKFLOW - HOW IT WORKS
=========================================

SCENARIO: 20 Alerts on Sold-Out Night
--------------------------------------

Phase 1: Review Alerts
----------------------
☐ Upgrade: Guest A (Third-Party) TDBN → TSVN
☐ Upgrade: Guest B (Hilton Go) KNGN → KSVN
☐ Cross-category: Guest C (Direct) TDBN → KNGN - Call for approval
☐ ADA Alert: Guest D NKSQA → KNGN - Coordinate with housekeeping
☐ Upgrade: Guest E (AAA) KSVN → KEXN
... (15 more alerts)

MOD Actions:
✓ Checked box 1: Called Guest A, approved upgrade
✓ Checked box 2: Called Guest B, approved upgrade
✗ Box 3 unchecked: Guest C didn't answer phone - need to retry
✓ Checked box 4: Coordinated with housekeeping for Guest D
✗ Box 5 unchecked: Can't upgrade Guest E - no KEXN available, need GM approval
... (continue handling)

Button now shows: "Finalize 15 Approved (5 Remain)"

Phase 2: Finalize Partial
--------------------------
Click "Finalize 15 Approved (5 Remain)"

RESULT:
✓ 15 guests assigned and ready for check-in
⚠️ 5 guests remain unresolved:
  - Guest C: Still need to call for cross-category approval
  - Guest E: Escalated to GM for named suite approval
  - Guest F: Walk guest - no suitable room
  - Guest G: Waiting callback from guest
  - Guest H: Need to coordinate with maintenance

Final Assignments Table:
------------------------
Shows the 15 finalized assignments

Unresolved Alerts Section:
--------------------------
Lists the 5 remaining issues with details

MOD Next Steps:
- Continue working on the 5 unresolved
- Can handle them over next 1-2 hours
- Doesn't block check-in for the 15 resolved guests


OLD WORKFLOW (Before v1.2):
----------------------------
✗ All 20 alerts MUST be checked before finalizing
✗ Can't proceed until everything resolved
✗ Blocks check-in for everyone if one guest unreachable


NEW WORKFLOW (v1.2+):
---------------------
✓ Handle what you can immediately
✓ Finalize those assignments
✓ Continue working on remaining issues
✓ Flexible and realistic for busy MOD operations
