This dataset represents REALISTIC hotel operations during peak Atlanta event 
season. Downtown hotels near GWCC and State Farm Arena regularly experience 
these occupancy patterns during convention and major event periods.


SOLD OUT / OVERBOOKED NIGHTS (11 nights - 35.5%)
================================================================================

🔴 CRITICAL OVERBOOKING SCENARIOS (16+ rooms over):
----------------------------------------------------
• Jan 17 (Saturday): 337 rooms (+16 over) - GWCC Convention + Hawks vs Celtics
• Jan 18 (Sunday): 337 rooms (+16 over) - GWCC Convention + Christian Concert  
• Feb 13 (Friday): 337 rooms (+16 over) - B2K Concert + Valentine's Weekend

These dates require AGGRESSIVE room balancing:
→ Multiple suite upgrades needed
→ Named suites (Governor's, Presidential) may be used
→ Algorithm must prioritize Diamond/Gold status upgrades
→ Some guests may need to be walked if upgrades exhausted


🔴 MODERATE OVERBOOKING SCENARIOS (9-12 rooms over):
-----------------------------------------------------
• Jan 19 (Monday): 333 rooms (+12 over) - MLK Day + Hawks game + GWCC Convention
• Jan 28 (Wednesday): 330 rooms (+9 over) - Trade Show peak day
• Jan 31 (Saturday): 333 rooms (+12 over) - Monster Trucks family event
• Feb 1 (Sunday): 330 rooms (+9 over) - Monster Trucks Day 2

Algorithm must:
→ Upgrade Diamond/Gold guests to available premium rooms
→ Use park view upgrades strategically
→ Maintain same bed-type when possible (King→King, Double→Double)
→ Keep families with connecting/adjacent rooms


🔴 MINOR OVERBOOKING SCENARIOS (3-6 rooms over):
-------------------------------------------------
• Jan 16 (Friday): 327 rooms (+6 over) - GWCC Convention starts + MLK weekend
• Jan 23 (Friday): 324 rooms (+3 over) - Hawks vs Suns
• Feb 12 (Thursday): 327 rooms (+6 over) - Pre-concert + Valentine's arrivals

Algorithm can:
→ Use standard upgrade path (KNGN → KSVN, TDBN → TSVN)
→ Minimal suite usage needed
→ Focus on Honors status hierarchy


⚫ EXACT CAPACITY (0 rooms over):
----------------------------------
• Jan 27 (Tuesday): 321 rooms (SOLD OUT at capacity) - Trade Show starts

No overbooking, but:
→ Zero inventory for walk-ins
→ No room for changes or special requests
→ Any cancellations = critical revenue management decisions


NEAR SELLOUT NIGHTS (95-99% occupancy - 4 nights)
================================================================================

🟡 Jan 20 (Tuesday): 314 rooms (97.8%) - MLK holiday Monday
🟡 Jan 29 (Thursday): 317 rooms (98.8%) - Trade Show + Hawks vs Rockets
🟡 Feb 6 (Friday): 308 rooms (96.0%) - Weekend before Hawks game
🟡 Feb 7 (Saturday): 314 rooms (97.8%) - Hawks game Saturday night

These nights have 7-13 rooms remaining:
→ Mostly suite inventory left
→ Limited standard room availability
→ Prepare for possible same-day overbooking
→ Hold back named suites unless necessary


HIGH OCCUPANCY NIGHTS (85-94% occupancy - 8 nights)
================================================================================

🟢 Jan 15 (Thursday): 282 rooms (87.9%) - Post-Peach Bowl departures
🟢 Jan 21 (Wednesday): 279 rooms (86.9%) - Post-MLK midweek
🟢 Jan 24 (Saturday): 295 rooms (91.9%) - Weekend demand
🟢 Jan 26 (Monday): 298 rooms (92.8%) - Hawks vs Pacers
🟢 Jan 30 (Friday): 301 rooms (93.8%) - Pre-Monster Trucks arrivals
🟢 Feb 2 (Monday): 282 rooms (87.9%) - Post-Monster Trucks departures
🟢 Feb 5 (Thursday): 292 rooms (91.0%) - Hawks game Thursday
🟢 Feb 14 (Saturday): 301 rooms (93.8%) - Valentine's Day departures

Strong demand but manageable:
→ 26-39 rooms remaining
→ Good mix of room types available
→ Standard upgrade paths work well
→ Minimal suite usage needed


NORMAL OCCUPANCY NIGHTS (Below 85% - 8 nights)
================================================================================

⚪ Jan 22 (Thursday): 253 rooms (78.8%)
⚪ Jan 25 (Sunday): 263 rooms (81.9%)
⚪ Feb 3 (Tuesday): 234 rooms (72.9%)

→ Standard operations


EVENT CORRELATION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

PRIMARY DRIVERS OF SOLD OUT NIGHTS:
------------------------------------

1. **GWCC Conventions + Weekend = OVERBOOKED**
   Jan 16-19 (4 consecutive nights) - Convention + MLK Weekend
   → Hotel 100% full Thursday-Monday
   → Combination of business and leisure travel
   → Highest demand period in entire dataset

2. **Major Concerts = OVERBOOKED**
   Jan 18: Christian Concert (337 rooms +16 over)
   Feb 13: B2K & Bow Wow (337 rooms +16 over)
   → Concert crowds book aggressively
   → Multi-night stays common
   → High no-show risk requires overbooking strategy

3. **Family Events = OVERBOOKED**
   Jan 31-Feb 1: Monster Trucks (333-330 rooms)
   → Families book 2-3 night stays
   → Higher demand for double/double rooms
   → Connecting room requests increase

4. **Trade Shows = CAPACITY**
   Jan 27-28: GWCC Trade Show (321-330 rooms)
   → Business travelers dominate
   → King room demand high
   → Length of stay: 2-3 nights


SECONDARY FACTORS:
------------------

• **Hawks Games** add 8-12% occupancy lift
  → Friday/Saturday games = higher impact
  → Holiday games (MLK) = maximum impact
  → Thursday games = moderate impact

• **Weekend Effect** adds 5-10% occupancy
  → Leisure travelers extend business trips
  → Friday arrivals for Saturday events
  → Sunday departures common

• **Holiday Impact** (MLK Weekend)
  → 3-day weekend creates extended stays
  → Jan 17-20 sustained 95-105% occupancy
  → Monday game on holiday = peak demand


REALISTIC OVERBOOKING STRATEGY
================================================================================

Hotels overbook based on historical no-show rates and cancellation patterns.
Embassy Suites downtown Atlanta would use these guidelines:

**AGGRESSIVE OVERBOOKING (3-5% over capacity):**
• Major holidays (MLK, Valentine's)
• Multi-event days (Convention + Concert + Game)
• Friday/Saturday peak nights
• Result: 330-337 rooms (9-16 over capacity)

**MODERATE OVERBOOKING (2-3% over capacity):**
• Trade show peak days
• Single major events (concerts, family events)
• Thursday/Sunday high demand
• Result: 327-330 rooms (6-9 over capacity)

**MINIMAL OVERBOOKING (0-1% over capacity):**
• Hawks games alone
• Regular weekend demand
• Pre-event arrival nights
• Result: 321-324 rooms (0-3 over capacity)


ROOM BALANCING ALGORITHM TEST SCENARIOS
================================================================================

**SCENARIO 1: MAXIMUM STRESS TEST**
Date: Jan 18, 2026 (Sunday)
Occupancy: 337 rooms (+16 over capacity)
Event: GWCC Convention + Christian Concert + MLK Weekend

Algorithm must:
→ Upgrade 16+ Diamond/Gold guests to premium inventory
→ Use suite upgrades if standard premiums exhausted
→ Maintain connecting rooms for families (concert crowd)
→ Walk lowest-status guests only if all upgrades exhausted
→ Generate report showing upgrade decisions and reasoning


**SCENARIO 2: BUSINESS TRAVEL OVERBOOKING**
Date: Jan 28, 2026 (Wednesday)  
Occupancy: 330 rooms (+9 over capacity)
Event: GWCC Trade Show peak day

Algorithm must:
→ Focus on King room upgrades (business travelers)
→ Prioritize Diamond/Gold (corporate accounts)
→ Use KNGN → KSVN → KEXN → Suite progression
→ Minimize double room upgrades (fewer families)


**SCENARIO 3: FAMILY EVENT OVERBOOKING**
Date: Jan 31, 2026 (Saturday)
Occupancy: 333 rooms (+12 over capacity)
Event: Monster Trucks Live family event

Algorithm must:
→ Focus on double room upgrades (families)
→ Preserve connecting room assignments
→ Use TDBN → TSVN → TCSN progression
→ Keep families with same bed type
→ Consider suite upgrades for large families only


**SCENARIO 4: EXACT CAPACITY**
Date: Jan 27, 2026 (Tuesday)
Occupancy: 321 rooms (SOLD OUT at capacity)

Algorithm must:
→ Assign all 321 rooms without upgrades
→ Maintain ADA room availability
→ Balance floor assignments
→ Prepare for possible walk-ins (walk scenarios)


**SCENARIO 5: NORMAL OPERATIONS**
Date: Feb 4, 2026 (Wednesday)
Occupancy: 243 rooms (75.7%)

Algorithm must:
→ Standard room assignments
→ Honor all upgrade requests
→ Maintain suite availability for upsells
→ Normal operational workflow


HONORS STATUS DISTRIBUTION IN DATASET
================================================================================

Distribution matches realistic business/leisure mix:
• Lifetime Diamond: 5% (~185 reservations)
• Diamond: 10% (~370 reservations)
• Gold: 15% (~555 reservations)
• Silver: 30% (~1,110 reservations)
• Blue: 20% (~740 reservations)
• Non-Members: 20% (~740 reservations)

**On overbooked nights**, upgrade priority:
1. Lifetime Diamond + 3+ night stays
2. Diamond + 3+ night stays
3. Gold + 3+ night stays
4. Lifetime Diamond (any LOS)
5. Diamond (any LOS)
6. Gold (any LOS)
7. Silver (long stays only)


LENGTH OF STAY PATTERNS
================================================================================

Dataset reflects realistic booking patterns:
• 1 night: 12% (walk-ins, local guests, game attendees)
• 2 nights: 38% (conventions, concerts, weekend stays)
• 3 nights: 35% (conventions, extended leisure)
• 4 nights: 12% (extended business, vacation)
• 5 nights: 3% (week-long conventions, relocations)

Average LOS: 2.4 nights (realistic for downtown business hotel)


ROOM TYPE DEMAND DISTRIBUTION
================================================================================

Based on 321-room inventory allocation:
• KNGN (Standard King): 94 rooms (29%) - Business travelers
• TDBN (Standard Double): 126 rooms (39%) - Families, groups, leisure
• KSVN (Park View King): 44 rooms (14%) - Upgraded business travelers
• TSVN (Park View Double): 20 rooms (6%) - Premium families
• NKSQA (ADA King): 13 rooms (4%) - ADA compliance
• Other Premium/Suites: 24 rooms (8%) - High-status upgrades

On sold out nights:
→ Standard inventory fills first
→ Park view rooms used for upgrades
→ ADA rooms assigned only when needed (legal requirement)
→ Suites used as last resort for Diamond/Gold upgrades
